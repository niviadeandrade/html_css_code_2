     <h2>HTML INFORMATION</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</li>
     <li>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</li>
     <li>It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</li>
     <li>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.</li>
     <li>A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the 'canvas' element, together with JavaScript.</li>
     <li>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</li>
     <li>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. </li>
     </ul>
     
     <h2>CSS INFORMATION</h2>
     <ul>
     <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</li>
     <li>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.</li>
     <li>The separation provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.</li>
     <li>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods. </li>
     <li>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.</li>
     <li>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
     <li>Internet media type (MIME type) <b>text/css</b> is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</li>
     </ul>
